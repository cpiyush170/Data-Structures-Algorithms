Heap is a complele binary tree satisfying any one of the conditions either as max-heap or min-heap. Heaps are represented mostly using array. As it is the complete binary
tree, the height of binary tree will be log n only. Therefore, the height of heap is also log n.

Types of heap:
Max-heap: It is a complete binary tree where every node has value greater than or equal to all its descendants.
Min-heap: It is a complete binary tree where every node has value smaller than or equal to all its descendants.
